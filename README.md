# PHYSICS ENGINE
This is a Java Script project which which runs the physics engine this engine contains gravity, mass, friction, wind force.

# FEATURES
//1.Now you can increase the number of entity [ball]
2.you can change the value of these variables at runtime [gravity, mass, radius, wind force] 
3.It is easy to undustand the code and develop the new physics 
4.You can pull request a new feature

# FUTURE PROPERTIES AND PHYSICS
1.collision
2.air drag
3.addition of restart button so that u have to not type the value of [gravity, mass, radius, wind force]
4.entity can be given random color or colour of your choice
5.new objects added like square, ellipse etc
