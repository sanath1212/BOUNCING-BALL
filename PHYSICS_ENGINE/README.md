# PHYSICS ENGINE
This is a Java Script project which which runs the physics engine this engine contains gravity, mass, friction, wind force.

# FEATURES
Now you can increase the number of entity [ball].you can change the value of these variables at runtime [gravity, mass, radius, wind force].It is easy to undustand the code and develop the new physics .You can pull request a new feature

# FUTURE PROPERTIES AND PHYSICS
collision.air drag.addition of restart button so that u have to not type the value of [gravity, mass, radius, wind force].entity can be given random color or colour of your choice.new objects added like square, ellipse etc
